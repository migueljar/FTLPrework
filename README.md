2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The biggest challenge I faced while creating this submission was the interview video I had to create. I have always struggled with verbally communicating my ideas and thoughts to other people. During my submission, I had to do multiple run-throughs and takes of my interview video because I stuttered often or didn’t convey my ideas the way I wanted to. To overcome this challenge, I began to take notes on what I wanted to say for each interview question. I would read through the main points on my notes and would start the recording again. In addition to writing notes, I would repeat my answer in my head more than once right before starting the recording. To help me communicate what I had written down I also started to talk through my ideas with another person verbally. This helped me get a grasp of how I was going to answer the questions. After trying these different methods, it was a process of recording and restarting if I was not satisfied with the answer I gave. I began to push through small mess-ups I had and gave my best effort at speaking as clearly as I could. As you may note in the video, I am not the most eloquent with my words, but I tried my best to share with you my answers to the questions.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[A question that I have about web development after completing this submission is which frameworks should I use to begin learning web development? Should I start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript rather than other platforms? I have seen several programs use Ionic, React, Angular and others that have their own libraries and tools for web development. Is it bad to begin working with React from the start since it can make some aspects of creating the front-end of a web application easier? Another question I have is regarding CSS, is CSS used for most modern websites seen or are different languages used to design those? I have seen a lot of websites that have very versatile and unique designs/layouts and I wonder if all these designs are possible using CSS. I would also like to learn more about what the limits and strengths of different web development frameworks are.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend them on adding a feature that allows the user to customize the game with more of their preferences. I would like the user to be able to adjust the difficulty of the game to their liking by being able to choose which aspect of the game they’d like to make more challenging. This feature would give the user freedom to add or decrease buttons, decrease the time of the playback, increase the length of the playback pattern, and add strikes to the game. It would be set up as a menu where the user can see what is available to customize, as well as an info button that briefly explains how each customization would affect the gameplay. I would also spend some time on updating the front end of the website by giving it a more modern and sophisticated look. Some ideas I have for this is to make the buttons look like physical 3-dimensional buttons or giving the game a more brightly colored look with a bright color scheme. Another feature I would implement is a leaderboard. This would make the game more interesting for the player as it would add a competitive component to the game. The user would be able to submit their score with their name to the leaderboard and it could be displayed on the website for everyone to see.]
