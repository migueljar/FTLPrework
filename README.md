2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Coding wise I didn’t really encounter any challenges with creating the game, however I encountered a challenge with this submission when I had to create gifs in a link format. I have only ever recorded and saved gifs locally and didn’t know where I could record gifs with a link. I overcame this challenge by first looking through the pre-work instructions to check if any instructions were given or if any websites were given to make gifs accessible with links. I did not find anything on the instructions, but I did see that a slack was given for any prework questions. I joined the slack and searched up “gif” to find anything that could help with my issue. Luckily, a TA had answered someone with a similar question, and they provided two websites called “giphy” and “ezgif”. I tried using both, however, they both gave me issues such as the gif being blurry and the link not being permanent. After this, I remembered that I had uploaded gifs into a GitHub repository for the CodePath Software Security class. I also saw in the slack that someone did something similar and a TA mentioned it was okay to do that. Therefore, I uploaded them to the GitHub repository I am using for the prework and put their link on the Readme file as well as in the additional comments for safety.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[A question that I have about web development after completing this submission is which frameworks should I use to begin learning web development? Should I start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript rather than other platforms? I have seen several programs use Ionic, React, Angular and others that have their own libraries and tools for web development. Is it bad to begin working with React from the start since it can make some aspects of creating the front-end of a web application easier? Another question I have is regarding CSS, is CSS used for most modern websites seen or are different languages used to design those? I have seen a lot of websites that have very versatile and unique designs/layouts and I wonder if all these designs are possible using CSS. I would also like to learn more about what the limits and strengths of different web development frameworks are.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend them on adding a feature that allows the user to customize the game with more of their preferences. I would like the user to be able to adjust the difficulty of the game to their liking by being able to choose which aspect of the game they’d like to make more challenging. This feature would give the user freedom to add or decrease buttons, decrease the time of the playback, increase the length of the playback pattern, and add strikes to the game. It would be set up as a menu where the user can see what is available to customize, as well as an info button that briefly explains how each customization would affect the gameplay. I would also spend some time on updating the front end of the website by giving it a more modern and sophisticated look. Some ideas I have for this is to make the buttons look like physical 3-dimensional buttons or giving the game a more brightly colored look with a bright color scheme. Another feature I would implement is a leaderboard. This would make the game more interesting for the player as it would add a competitive component to the game. The user would be able to submit their score with their name to the leaderboard and it could be displayed on the website for everyone to see.]
